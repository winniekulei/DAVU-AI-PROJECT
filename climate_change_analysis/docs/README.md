# WII Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes climate data from various sectors in Bougouni, Koutiala, and Sikasso regions. The primary goal is to clean the raw data, perform analysis, and visualize the results to understand their effects on Yield in these three sectors. We formulate a model that factors in satisfaction index that seeks to measure the basis risk. The primary goal is to reduce basis risk in small holder farmers in the regions.

## Data Files
The raw data files used in this project are in Excel format (.xlsx):
- `BougouniSector_Average_JJA.xlsx`
- `KoutialaSector_Average_JJA.xlsx`
- `SikassoSector_Average_JJA.xlsx`

These files contain average climate data for various months across the respective sectors.

- **data/**: Contains the raw data files.
- **scripts/**: Contains R scripts for data cleaning and analysis, along with the shell script to execute them.
- **output/**: Contains the output plots generated from the analysis.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- R and RStudio
- Required R packages:
  - `readxl`
  - `dplyr`
  - `ggplot2`

You can install the required R packages using the following command in your R console:
```r
install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/climate-data-analysis.git
   cd climate-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the analysis script**:
   You can execute the `analysis_script.sh` to run both the data cleaning and analysis scripts:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/analysis_script.sh
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   After the script runs successfully, check the `output/` directory for the generated plots.
